# react-redux-app

For this app i used technologies:
React
Redux
Webpack
Sass
Bootstrap

To start the app install all needed dependancies:
npm install

to start the server run:
npm run dev-server

I have created two users so you can authenticate to the app:
username: vladimir
password: vladimir123

username: testing
password: testing123

The users are stored in the redux store.

After authentication the user is authorised to play the games.
